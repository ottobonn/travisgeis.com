The propeller clock\\u2019s circuit board rotates about its center (it is the shape of a rectangular propeller blade) and flashes the LEDs at very specific frequencies. The effect of the brief, precisely timed flashes of light, combined with the rotation of the circuit board at a specific frequency, exploits the persistence of vision (POV) of the human eye to create the illusion of a continuous plane of light in the form of a clock face.\"), mdx(\"p\", {\n    parentName: \"blockquote\"\n  }, \"The clock will measure its rotational frequency with a Hall effect (magnetic) sensor looking for a stationary reference magnet.

SMT is more difficult than the more hobbyist-friendly through-hole style of components, which have metal leads one can solder through holes in a circuit board.
